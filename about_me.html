                    <h2>About the Coder</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>My name is Amanda Weber, and I am a student at Grinnell College, class of 2021. I am a declared double major in Computer Science and English. I currently work as the Treasurer of Grinnell College Student Government Association, where I balance a $550,000 budget, advise on the financing of approximately 90 student groups, and liaise between students and administration about the financial needs of the student body.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my schoolwork and job, I work as an expungement volunteer for Iowa Legal Aid, which allows me to serve the greater Iowa community and to continue pursuing my passion for making the world a better place. In my free time, I like to write creatively, read, play tennis, and experiment with code.</p>
